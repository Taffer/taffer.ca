My extremely simple website.

If you plan on using this for your own evil purposes, note that the
`t2-uphigh` JPEG files are *Thief 2: The Metal Age* promo graphics created
by the late, lamented Looking Glass Studios, Inc. and that the Thief IP
is owned by Eidos, Inc.

The various icons are credited in the `index.html`, and are covered by their
own licensing terms.
